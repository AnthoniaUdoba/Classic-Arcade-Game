## Installing

You can clone the repo or download it as zip file by clicking on green button "Clone or Download". Once done, open Index.html on any browser of choice.

## Instructions

- Use the keyboard arrow keys to move around.
- The goal is to get to the water without colliding with the bugs.
- If you collide with any of the Bugs or reach the water (i.e., the top of the game board), you go back to the start positon.
