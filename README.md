# Classic Arcade Game Project

The project starter code was provided.

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the Bugs.

- The player can move left, right, up and down using the arrow keys.
- The Bugs move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
- Once a the player collides with a Bug, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
- Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won.
